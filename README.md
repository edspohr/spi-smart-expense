# SPI Smart Expense

A modern, intelligent expense tracking and management application designed to streamline the improved workflow between professionals submitting expenses and administrators managing project budgets.

This application leverages **Artificial Intelligence (Google Gemini)** to automate data entry from receipts, reducing manual errors and saving time.

---

## 🆕 Recent Features (v2.0)

- **Multi-currency totals**: All dashboard views now separate COP and USD expense totals, displayed as stacked currency blocks.
- **Automatic TRM capture**: When submitting or editing a USD expense, the app fetches the live USD→COP exchange rate (TRM) from `open.er-api.com` and stores `trm`, `amountCOP`, and `trmSource` on the expense document.
- **Receipt image viewer**: Full-screen lightbox with tab switching between Recibo and Voucher; PDF files show an "Abrir PDF" fallback link.
- **Expense editing**: Admins can edit any expense via the `EditExpenseModal` (amount, currency, description, TRM recalculation).
- **Tarjeta / empresa**: Card last-4 and card company captured at submission, visible in approvals table and expense details.
- **Assistant role**: New `assistant` Firestore role that can submit expenses on behalf of others.
- **Reports page** (`/admin/reports`): Advanced filters (user, cost center, date range, currency, status, card company) with CSV export, Excel export (with auto-column widths and summary rows), and ZIP download of all receipt images.
- **Optimized bundle**: Vite `manualChunks` splits the build into `vendor-firebase`, `vendor-react`, `vendor-ui`, and `vendor-utils` for faster page loads.

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

The application follows a serverless architecture pattern, relying on Firebase for backend services and Google Gemini for cognitive tasks.

## 🔄 Functional Logic Workflows

### 1. Expense Submission Flow (Professional)

This workflow details how a user submits an expense using AI assistance.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant UI as Frontend UI
    participant AI as Gemini Service
    participant DB as Firestore
    participant Storage as Firebase Storage

    User->>UI: Upload Receipt Image
    UI->>AI: Send Image for Analysis
    activate AI
    AI-->>UI: Return Extracted Data (JSON)
    deactivate AI

    UI->>User: Display Form with Pre-filled Data
    User->>UI: Modify/Confirm Data
    User->>UI: Click "Submit"

    UI->>Storage: Upload Image File
    Storage-->>UI: Return Download URL

    UI->>DB: Save Expense Record (Status: PENDING)
    DB-->>UI: Confirmation
    UI-->>User: Show Success Message
```

### 2. Expense Approval Flow (Admin)

How an administrator reviews and approves expenses, affecting project budgets and user balances.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Admin Opens Dashboard] --> B{Review Pending Expenses}
    B -->|Select Expense| C[View Details & Receipt]

    C --> D{Decision?}

    D -- Approve --> E[Update Status to APPROVED]
    E --> F[Deduct from Project Budget]
    E --> G[Update User Balance]

    D -- Reject --> H[Update Status to REJECTED]
    H --> I[Add Rejection Reason]
    I --> J[Notify User]

    F --> K[Save to Firestore]
    G --> K
```
